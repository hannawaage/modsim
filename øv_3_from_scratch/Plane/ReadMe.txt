- Run PlaneDemo1.m to see the "mechanics" of the rotation 1,2,3
- Run PlaneDemo1Singularity.m to see what it means that this rotation choice becomes singular

PlaneDemo2.m / PlaneDemo2Singularity.m and
PlaneDemo3.m / PlaneDemo3Singularity.m

are showing similar things for two other choices of rotation
